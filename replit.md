# EduNexus - Student Community Platform

## Overview

EduNexus is a comprehensive multi-school management platform designed to centralize academic, administrative, and communication processes for educational institutions. The platform enables schools to manage their daily operations through a unified system while maintaining secure and independent data environments for each institution.

The application provides tools for student enrollment, attendance tracking, grade management, academic records, schedules, disciplinary observations, report cards, institutional communications, and document management. It supports multiple user roles, including administrators, teachers, students, parents, and staff members, ensuring appropriate access to information and functionalities.

EduNexus allows educational institutions to configure their own academic structure, grading systems, school calendars, departments, courses, and user permissions. Through centralized data management, automated workflows, reporting tools, and integrated communication channels, the platform improves operational efficiency, enhances collaboration between school stakeholders, and supports informed educational decision-making.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript, using Wouter for client-side routing.

**UI Component System**: Built on shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives) with Tailwind CSS for styling.

**State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for auth state.

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.

**Authentication**: Cookie-based sessions with localStorage fallback for UX.

**Design System**: 
- Typography: Inter (UI) and Poppins (headings)
- Responsive layouts with elevation system for depth
- Light/dark mode support

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.

**API Pattern**: RESTful with conventional HTTP methods.

**Authentication**: Simple email/password with bcryptjs hashing.
- Registration: Email validation, password hashing, user creation
- Login: Email/password verification against hash
- Session: HTTP-only cookies with 7-day expiration
- Middleware: Session loading attaches user to request object

**Authorization**: Role-based (student, teacher, admin) with middleware:
- `requireAuth`: Checks session exists and user is logged in
- `requireVerified`: Ensures user email is verified
- `requireAdmin`: Ensures user has admin role
- Teachers can access badge assignment UI in profiles

**Password Security**: 
- Bcryptjs with 10 salt rounds for hashing
- Password never stored in plaintext
- Hash comparison during login verification

**File Handling**: Multer middleware with 10MB limit and file type validation.

**Database Access Layer**: Storage abstraction with IStorage interface.

### Data Storage

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.

**Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL.

**Session Store**: In-memory MemoryStore (suitable for development).

**Schema Design**:
- User profiles with password hash, roles, verification status
- Groups (courses/clubs) with member tracking
- Posts with comments and reactions
- Files with visibility controls
- Events (tutoring) with participants
- Reports for moderation
- Messages for group chat
- **Badges (NEW)**: badges table with 25+ definitions + userBadges assignment table
- Recognitions/Shoutouts with images
- Notifications and notification preferences

### External Dependencies

**Core**:
- Neon Database: PostgreSQL hosting
- bcryptjs: Password hashing

**Frontend**:
- Radix UI: Accessible components
- TanStack Query: Server state management
- date-fns: Date utilities
- Wouter: Lightweight routing

**Backend**:
- Express.js: Server framework
- express-session: Session middleware
- MemoryStore: In-memory session storage
- Multer: File upload handling

**Security**:
- HTTP-only cookies (XSS protection)
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- Input validation with Zod
- Role-based access control middleware

## Authentication Flow

### Registration
1. User navigates to `/register`
2. Enters: name, email, password
3. Backend validates email format and password length
4. Password is hashed with bcryptjs
5. User created in database
6. Session is automatically created and stored in HTTP-only cookie
7. User is logged in automatically

### Login
1. User navigates to `/login`
2. Enters email and password
3. Backend retrieves user by email
4. Compares provided password against stored hash
5. If valid, session is created and stored in HTTP-only cookie
6. User is logged in

### Session Management
1. All authenticated requests verify `req.session.userId` exists
2. Session middleware loads user from database on each request
3. User is attached to `req.user` for downstream middleware/routes
4. Cookies expire after 7 days of inactivity
5. On logout, session is destroyed and cookie is cleared

### Frontend Session Persistence
1. AuthContext loads user from localStorage on app start
2. Verifies session with `/api/auth/user` endpoint
3. If session is invalid, clears localStorage
4. On page focus, re-verifies session to catch logout from other tabs
